# JobControl

A TYPO3 extension for showing jobs, in development since April 2007.

## What does it do
JobControl (dmmjobcontrol) is a TYPO3 extension for showing jobs (“vacancies”) on your website. It provides a list- and detailview and the ability to search and apply for jobs. It can even make RSS feeds of your joblist.

It works with html templates so it's easy to configure how the extension will look for your site. The list can be shown as a “paginated list”, including a page-browser. The extension itself is multi-lingual, at this moment English, Danish, Polish, German, Russian and Dutch are included. The best feature however is that multi-lingual jobs are fully supported too, so you can provide a translation for a job if you have a multi-lingual site.

JobControl uses MM-relation tables for regions, branches, sectors etc. This means that for every new site, you can make a new list of branches to use. They are not hardcoded and don't require any TypoScript to set up.

JobControl is very easy to set up, with good default templates that can be styled to your needs using css stylesheets. It's very powerful and flexible too with lots of configuration options for advanced users.
